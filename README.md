## 🚀 Overview

**CircularOpt** is a conceptual AI-powered platform designed to tackle the construction industry's significant sustainability challenges. It leverages multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and optimization algorithms to recommend sustainable building materials and minimize waste, promoting circular economy principles.

This repository serves as a **proof-of-concept and a living document** for the initial idea, problem definition, and proposed architectural solution. The implementation is under active development and will be updated in future commits.

## 📋 The Problem

The construction industry is a major contributor to global resource consumption and waste generation. Current material selection processes are inefficient, often overlooking environmental impact in favor of cost and performance, leading to:

*   **High embodied carbon** in structures.
*   **Excessive material waste** due to poor planning.
*   **Lack of integrated tools** for sustainable decision-making.

> **See the detailed [Problem Statement](PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md).**

## 💡 The Proposed Solution

CircularOpt proposes a holistic software solution centered around an AI recommendation engine that evaluates materials based on:
*   **Sustainability** (Embodied Carbon, Recyclability)
*   **Cost** (Initial and Lifecycle)
*   **Performance** (Strength, Durability)

The proposed system integrates key modules for:
*   **Waste Optimization** using cutting-stock algorithms.
*   **Carbon Footprint Calculation** across the project lifecycle.
*   **Timeline Forecasting** based on material complexity.
*   **Circular Economy Metrics** tracking.

## 🧠 Core Objectives (From Original Synopsis)

1.  **AI-Powered Material Recommendation:** Develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) engine.
2.  **Waste Optimization Algorithms:** Implement cutting stock-based algorithms to minimize leftover materials.
3.  **Carbon Footprint Calculator:** Estimate embodied carbon from material choices.
4.  **Construction Timeline Forecasting:** Provide predictive timelines based on project complexity.
5.  **Circular Economy Integration:** Encourage the use of recyclable and low-carbon materials.

## 🔬 Ideation & Proof of Existence

This concept was first formalized in **September 2025** as part of an academic mini-project. This Git repository establishes the public proof of existence for this idea and its continuous development.
