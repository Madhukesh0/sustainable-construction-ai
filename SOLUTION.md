# Proposed Solution Architecture

## System Overview

CircularOpt is conceived as a web-based platform with a modular architecture, comprising a backend API and an interactive frontend dashboard. The core intelligence is driven by a recommendation engine and optimization algorithms.

## Core Modules

### 1. AI-Powered Recommendation Engine
*   **Function:** Evaluates and ranks construction materials.
*   **Methodology:** Employs a **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)** model with configurable weights for Sustainability (40%), Cost (30%), and Performance (30%).
*   **Inputs:** Project parameters (type, size, budget, location, load requirements).
*   **Outputs:** A list of recommended materials with detailed scores and justification.

### 2. Waste Optimization Module
*   **Function:** Minimizes material waste from cutting processes.
*   **Methodology:** Implements a **First-Fit Decreasing (FFD)** cutting stock algorithm.
*   **Inputs:** Material dimensions, standard stock sizes, project requirements.
*   **Outputs:** Optimized cutting plans, predicted waste percentage, and potential cost savings.

### 3. Carbon Footprint Calculator
*   **Function:** Estimates the total embodied carbon of a project.
*   **Methodology:** Calculates carbon based on material choices, adds construction phase emissions (~15%), and transportation impact.
*   **Inputs:** Selected materials and quantities.
*   **Outputs:** Total kgCOâ‚‚e, carbon per sq ft, breakdown by material category, and a sustainability rating.

### 4. Timeline Forecasting Module
*   **Function:** Predicts project duration based on complexity.
*   **Methodology:** Uses base duration factors adjusted for project type, size, floors, and material complexity.
*   **Outputs:** Phased timeline (Foundation, Structure, Finishing), total duration, and critical path.

### 5. Circular Economy Dashboard
*   **Function:** Tracks project performance against circularity goals.
*   **Metrics:** Average recycled content, recyclability, count of carbon-negative materials, local sourcing percentage.

## Proposed Tech Stack (Conceptual)

*   **Backend:** Python (FastAPI/Flask), PostgreSQL database.
*   **Frontend:** React.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
*   **Algorithms:** Custom MCDA logic, Optimization algorithms (FFD).
*   **Deployment:** Docker, cloud platform (AWS/Azure).

## Data Model

The system relies on a comprehensive database of materials with attributes including:
*   Name, Category, Cost, Unit
*   Embodied Carbon, Strength, Density
*   Recycled Content (%), Recyclability (%)
*   Durability, Thermal Properties, Supplier Info
