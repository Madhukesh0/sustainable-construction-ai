# Detailed Problem Statement

## The Global Construction Sustainability Crisis

The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry is one of the largest consumers of raw materials globally, accounting for nearly **50% of resource use** and generating significant waste. Traditional material selection prioritizes cost and performance but often overlooks critical sustainability factors, leading to excessive waste and high embodied carbon.

## Specific Challenges

1.  **Lack of Intelligent Decision-Support Tools:**
    *   Current design software fails to integrate sustainability metrics (e.g., embodied carbon, recyclability).
    *   No predictive waste analysis during the planning phase.
    *   Inability to effectively balance multi-criteria trade-offs between sustainability, cost, and performance.

2.  **Inefficient Material Management:**
    *   Projects often result in higher material costs and environmental harm due to poor waste forecasting.
    *   Lack of optimization leads to inefficient cutting plans and significant leftover materials.

3.  **Opacity in Environmental Impact:**
    *   Project managers and architects lack tools to quickly assess the full carbon footprint of their material choices.
    *   No benchmarking against sustainability standards or certifications.

## Consequences

This gap in the tooling results in:
*   **Higher project costs** from material overuse and waste disposal.
*   **Unnecessary environmental harm** due to avoidable carbon emissions.
*   **Inefficiencies** in construction workflows and planning.
*   **Slower adoption** of sustainable and circular economy practices.
